2.4. Exit File Selection

    2.4.1: Provide the option to exit the selection process using a specific string (e.g., "exit").
    2.4.2: Confirm the exit action to avoid accidental exits.

2.5. New File Selection

    2.5.1: Implement a function to reset the current file selection.
    2.5.2: Allow the user to select a different file while providing an option to discard the current selection.

3. File Analysis

3.1. Reading Contents

    3.1.1: Develop a method to read the contents of the selected file (similar to readFile()).
    3.1.2: Implement error handling for issues like file not found or unreadable content.

3.2. Tracking Words

    3.2.1: Write a function to split the text into individual words (similar to countWordsAndAnalyze()).
    3.2.2: Implement logic to handle blank spaces and special characters.
    3.2.3: Strip punctuation from words before counting occurrences.

3.3. Word Occurrence Tracking

    3.3.1: Implement a dictionary (or collections.Counter) to track word occurrences efficiently.
    3.3.2: Develop a method to populate this data structure as the file is read.

3.4. Output Messages

    3.4.1: Create output messages to display file contents in a user-friendly manner (like printFileContents()).
    3.4.2: Provide options to show the entire content or a summary.

3.5. Menu Integration

    3.5.1: Include options in the user menu for reading and displaying file contents.
    3.5.2: Ensure the menu can trigger the reading and output functions.

4. Result Output

4.1. Result Output Formatting

    4.1.1: Create a function to output the word counts to the user (similar to printWordCountResults()).
    4.1.2: Format the output to display the word and its count clearly.

4.2. Advanced Formatting Options

    4.2.1: Implement formatting options (e.g., align text, add separators).
    4.2.2: Consider options for color-coding or highlighting important results.

4.3. Sort and Filter Output

    4.3.1: Implement options for sorting results alphabetically or by occurrence.
    4.3.2: Allow filtering of results to show only a specified number of entries.

5. Output Formatting

5.1. Formatted Output Options

    5.1.1: Develop options for displaying results in various formats (e.g., lists, tables).
    5.1.2: Ensure that users can select their preferred output format.

5.2. Use of Libraries

    5.2.1: Research libraries like prettytable or tabulate for formatting output.
    5.2.2: Implement the chosen library into the output formatting functions.

6. User Interaction and Customization

6.1. Enhanced Menu Features

    6.1.1: Implement menu options for sorting results alphabetically or by occurrence.
    6.1.2: Allow filtering of results to show only a specified number of entries.

6.2. Windowed Interface Planning

    6.2.1: Research GUI libraries (e.g., Tkinter, PyQt) for potential future implementation.
    6.2.2: Draft mock-ups of the GUI layout and user flow.

7. Versioning Strategy

    7.1: Each implementation will be versioned systematically:
        Version 1.0: Core Setup.
        Version 1.1: File Manipulation.
        Version 1.2: File Analysis.
        Version 2.0: Output Formatting.
